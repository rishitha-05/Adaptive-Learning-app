## Description and title 
   It is an online adaptive learning education platform which test the knowledge of student and recommend him the essential material

# Getting Started with My Project
   I have used the ReactJs for the frontend and backend was done with Flask

   React app can be created with the help of
   # command
   npx create-react-app myapp

   # Setting up the Flask Backend
     mkdir my-flask-react-project
     cd my-flask-react-project
   # create variable environment
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate 
     pip install Flask
     touch server.py
   # Setting up the React Frontend 
     cd my-flask-react-project
     npx create-react-app frontend
     cd frontend
     npm start
   #  Integrating React with Flask
      1. Ensure that your Flask app serves the React build files. You can do this by setting up Flask to serve the static files generated by React.
      2. Update your Flask routes to serve the React index.html file for all routes except API routes. 

   # Running Both Projects in Visual Studio Code
     1. npm start 
     2. python server.py
